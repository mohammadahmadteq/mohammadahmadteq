# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my CODE ZONE!

I'm Mohammad Ahmad, a materials science and engineering graduate with a passion for **nanotechnology**. I'm also that person who dives into **software engineering** for fun and loves blending science with tech. (Yes, I'm aware it's a niche hobby).

### A Little About Me 🌱
- 🛠️ By day, I’m a software engineer working on healthcare applications and have experience in **domain-driven design**, **clean architecture**, and **SOLID principles**. By night, I’m often experimenting with AI-powered **characterization techniques** and **new materials simulation methods**.
- 🖥️ Languages I will use to dominate the world (Soon): **TypeScript** for silly webpages, **Rust** for memory-safe performance, and a decent dose of **C** for low-level programming.
- 🔬 I’m into simulating the future – especially with innovative materials and AI, because why not live on the edge of science and beat TSMC in their fab one day?

### Portfolio 🌐
Check out my projects and what I'm up to on my [portfolio](https://mohammadahmadteq.github.io/mohammad-portfolio/). You’ll find everything from the polished pieces to the experimental side projects (which may or may not work).

### The Stats ⚙️
- 👨‍💻 **Software Engineering**: 2+ years in healthcare apps, ensuring software that’s as clean as my SOLID principles.
- ✍️ **Current Learning Adventure**: Diving deeper into *SVG mysteries* and making browsers cooperate (looking at you, WebKit).
- ⚡ **Materials Science & Nanotech**: Focused on simulation techniques and AI-driven analysis.

### Art 🎨
Not everything I do is ones and zeros! I'm also an artist. You can catch my creative side over on Instagram [@mamber2403](https://instagram.com/mamber2403), where I share some of my latest work. None of that AI stuff all hand made with love!

### Fun Fact 🌍
My dad's an electrical engineer working in Oman, so technical curiosity might just be genetic. Also, I'm from Pakistan 🇵🇰, so I live in a silent hill game in winters for real!

Thanks for stopping by! If you’re into the world of science, tech, or just like watching someone eventually achieve total world dominion using silly inscryptions on their magic rocks (Coding on a PC since silicon is made from rock and sand get it?), feel free to follow along. 🚀
